## About me
I like to try evertithing new in my life. I've tried myself in different spheres: supplying of components for production of metering equipment, supplying of parts for TV production, project management.
The timely completion of tasks and the success of projects were due to excellent interaction with colleagues and accurate planning.
But over time, it's hard to stay without development, so I decided to start studying the IT-sphere.
